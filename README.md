_PyTorch implementation of the paper:_
#### Basset: Learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep convolutional neural networks ([paper](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2016/05/03/gr.200535.115.abstract))<br><br>


Based on the paper and the original implementation in lua language ([GitHub page](https://github.com/ljljolinq1010/Basset)), Basset provides researchers with tools to:

1. Train deep convolutional neural networks to learn highly accurate models of DNA sequence activity such as accessibility (via DNaseI-seq or ATAC-seq), protein binding (via ChIP-seq), and chromatin state.
2. Interpret the principles learned by the model.
